## Terminate All Calls to Numbers

Stop ALL active calls to specific phone numbers across ALL campaigns. This is the most comprehensive way to ensure certain numbers are no longer contacted.

<Warning>
**Global Impact**: This terminates calls to the specified numbers across ALL active campaigns, not just one campaign.
</Warning>

## When to Use This

- **Global Opt-Outs**: Customers who want to stop ALL calls from your organization
- **Legal Compliance**: Honor comprehensive do-not-call requests
- **Data Privacy**: Implement "right to be forgotten" requests
- **Emergency Stops**: Immediately halt all contact attempts to specific numbers
- **Account Closure**: Stop all calls when customers close accounts

## Scope of Termination

### ✅ What Gets Terminated:
- **All Campaigns**: Calls across every active campaign
- **All Call Types**: Both individual and campaign calls
- **Queued Calls**: All registered/retry status calls
- **Future Calls**: Prevents these numbers from being called again in current campaigns

### ❌ What Continues:
- **Other Numbers**: Calls to different numbers continue normally
- **Completed Calls**: Historical call data remains intact
- **Active Calls**: Currently connected calls finish naturally

## Perfect Use Cases

### Customer Service Integration
```json
// When customer calls support requesting no more calls
{
  "mobile_numbers": ["+918882876897"]
}
```

### Bulk Opt-Out Processing
```json
// Process multiple opt-out requests at once
{
  "mobile_numbers": [
    "+918882876897",
    "+918882876898", 
    "+918882876899"
  ]
}
```

### Account Deletion Workflow
When customers delete accounts, ensure no future contact across all campaigns.

## Important Considerations

### Number Format Requirements
- ✅ **Correct**: `+918882876897` (with country code)
- ✅ **Correct**: `+1234567890` (international format)
- ❌ **Wrong**: `8882876897` (missing country code)

### Limits & Constraints
- **Maximum**: 100 numbers per request
- **Rate Limits**: Standard API rate limits apply
- **Permanent**: Cannot undo this action for current campaigns

### Impact Analysis
Before using this endpoint, consider:
- **Business Impact**: How many campaigns will be affected?
- **Legal Requirements**: Is this necessary for compliance?
- **Alternative Actions**: Could campaign-specific termination work instead?

<Info>
**Best Practice**: Use this endpoint for definitive opt-outs. For temporary or campaign-specific issues, consider using the campaign-numbers endpoint instead.

## Integration Example

```javascript
// Example: Customer support integration
async function globalOptOut(phoneNumber) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/campaign/terminate/numbers', {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-API-KEY': 'your-api-key'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        mobile_numbers: [phoneNumber]
      })
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Customer successfully opted out of all campaigns');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Opt-out failed:', error);
  }
}
```
