## Delete Knowledge Base

Permanently delete a knowledge base and all its associated content including files, URLs, and FAQs.

<Warning>
**Permanent Action**:
- This operation cannot be undone
- All associated content will be permanently deleted
- Agents using this knowledge base will lose access to its content
- Rate limit: Maximum 10 requests per minute per workspace
</Warning>

## Before Deleting

Consider these steps before deleting a knowledge base:

1. **Check Agent Dependencies**: Verify no active agents are using this knowledge base
2. **Backup Important Content**: Download or note any critical information
3. **Review Usage**: Check if the knowledge base is referenced in any campaigns

## Response

On successful deletion, you'll receive:
- `message`: Confirmation message
- `kb_id`: ID of the deleted knowledge base

## Common Use Cases

- **Cleanup**: Remove test or outdated knowledge bases
- **Reorganization**: Delete before recreating with updated structure
- **Resource Management**: Free up workspace resources

<Note>
**Agent Impact**: If agents are actively using this knowledge base, they will immediately lose access. Update agent configurations before deletion to avoid disruptions.
</Note>

## Alternative: Edit Instead

Consider using [Edit Knowledge Base](/api-reference/endpoint/kb/edit-knowledge-base) instead if you only need to:
- Remove specific files or URLs
- Update content
- Add new information

Editing preserves the knowledge base ID and agent associations.
