## Assistant Configuration

- **Choose the right voice**: Select a voice that matches your brand personality and target audience. Test different voices to find the one that resonates best with your users.
- **Craft clear prompts**: Write concise, natural-sounding prompts that guide the conversation effectively.
- **Use custom variables**: Personalize conversations by incorporating custom variables like the caller's name, transaction details, or other relevant information.
- **Set appropriate voice speed**: Adjust the voice speed to ensure clarity. A moderate pace (around 1.0) works best for most use cases.

## Call Quality

- **Use Karnataka (KA) numbers**: For Indian audiences, numbers starting with 080 (Karnataka) often have better recognition and pickup rates.
- **Optimize call timing**: Schedule calls during business hours when recipients are more likely to answer.
- **Implement call retries**: Configure retry attempts for unanswered calls, but limit to 1-2 retries to avoid being perceived as spam.
- **Monitor call metrics**: Regularly review call duration, completion rates, and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

## Content Strategy

- **Keep introductions brief**: Start with a concise introduction that identifies the assistant and the purpose of the call.
- **Use natural language**: Write conversational scripts that sound human and avoid robotic language.
- **Prepare for common scenarios**: Anticipate different user responses and create appropriate handling paths.
- **Include clear call-to-actions**: End calls with clear next steps or instructions for the recipient.

## Technical Considerations

- **Test across different networks**: Ensure your calls perform well across various mobile networks and connection qualities.
- **Monitor latency**: Keep response times low to maintain natural conversation flow.
- **Implement proper error handling**: Create graceful fallbacks for when users provide unexpected responses.
- **Limit concurrent calls**: For bulk campaigns, start with a smaller number of concurrent calls (5–10) and gradually increase based on performance.
