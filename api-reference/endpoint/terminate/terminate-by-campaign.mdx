## Terminate Campaign Calls

Stop all active calls within a specific campaign. This terminates all queued and retry calls for the entire campaign.

<Warning>
**Campaign Impact**: This will terminate ALL active calls in the specified campaign, affecting all contacts in that campaign.
</Warning>

## When to Use This

- **Campaign Issues**: When a campaign has problems and needs to be stopped
- **Content Problems**: If the campaign script or agent has errors  
- **Budget Management**: When campaign costs exceed budget
- **Schedule Changes**: If campaign timing needs to be adjusted
- **Quality Control**: When campaign performance is poor

## What Gets Terminated

✅ **Calls that will be terminated:**
- All calls in "registered" status (queued and waiting)
- All calls in "retry" status (scheduled for retry)
- Affects ALL contacts within this specific campaign

❌ **Calls that won't be affected:**
- Calls from other campaigns
- Already completed calls in this campaign
- Calls currently in progress (connected)

## How to Get Campaign ID

Find your campaign ID from:
- **Campaign Dashboard**: Listed in your campaign management section
- **Campaign API**: Use `/campaign/all` to list campaigns with IDs
- **Campaign Creation**: Returned when you start a campaign
- **Reports**: Campaign reports include the campaign ID
