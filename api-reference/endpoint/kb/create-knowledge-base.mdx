## Create Knowledge Base

Create a new non-deterministic knowledge base that can be used to provide context and information to your AI agents. Knowledge bases support multiple content types including files, URLs, and FAQs.

<Warning>
**Rate Limits**:
- Maximum 10 requests per hour per workspace
- File size limit: 2 MB per file, 5 MB total
- Maximum 10 files and 20 URLs per request
</Warning>

## Content Types

### Files
Upload documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc.) to provide structured information to your knowledge base.
- Max 10 files per request
- 2 MB per file limit
- 5 MB total size limit

### URLs
Index web pages to automatically extract and store their content.
- Max 20 URLs per request
- URLs are crawled and indexed automatically
- Content is refreshed periodically

### FAQs
Provide question-answer pairs for deterministic responses to common queries.
```json
"faqs": "[{\"question\": \"What is your return policy?\", \"answer\": \"30-day money back guarantee\"}]"
```

## Processing Status

Knowledge base creation is asynchronous. The response includes:
- `kb_id`: Unique identifier for the knowledge base
- `processing_status`: Current status (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`)
- `files_queued`: Number of files being processed

Use the [Get Knowledge Base by ID](/api-reference/endpoint/kb/get-knowledge-base-by-id) endpoint to check processing status.

## Important Notes

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Files and URLs are processed in the background
- **Content Updates**: Use the [Edit Knowledge Base](/api-reference/endpoint/kb/edit-knowledge-base) endpoint to update content
- **Agent Integration**: Link knowledge bases to agents via the assistant configuration
