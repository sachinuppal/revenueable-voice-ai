## Terminate Specific Calls

Stop individual calls by providing their unique call IDs. This gives you precise control over which calls to terminate.

<Warning>
**Precision Required**: Make sure you have the correct call IDs. Invalid IDs will be ignored.
</Warning>

## When to Use This

- **Selective Termination**: Stop only specific problematic calls
- **Quality Control**: Terminate calls that aren't performing well
- **Customer Requests**: Stop calls to specific contacts who requested removal
- **Targeted Control**: Fine-grained call management

## How to Get Call IDs

You can find call IDs from:
- **Call History API**: Use the [Get Call History](/api-reference/endpoint/history/get-call-history) endpoint
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboard call monitoring section
- **Webhook Notifications**: Call status updates include call IDs
- **Campaign Reports**: Export campaign data to get call IDs

## Request Format

Send an array of call IDs to terminate:

```json
{
  "call_ids": [
    "86815974-8a87-4e32-9953-aca4f97868ab",
    "9ab99d2d-595c-4ca1-bab7-07d13f253156"
  ]
}
```

<Info>
**Tip**: You can terminate up to 100 calls in a single request for efficient bulk operations.
