## Terminate Campaign Numbers

Stop calls to specific phone numbers within a particular campaign. This gives you precise control to remove individual contacts from an active campaign.

<Warning>
**Targeted Termination**: This only affects the specified numbers within the given campaign. The same numbers in other campaigns will continue.
</Warning>

## When to Use This

- **Customer Requests**: When contacts ask to be removed from calls
- **Data Quality**: Remove invalid or problematic numbers from campaign
- **Compliance**: Honor do-not-call requests for specific numbers
- **Selective Control**: Keep campaign running but exclude certain contacts
- **A/B Testing**: Stop calls to control group numbers

## Perfect For

### Customer Opt-Outs
Quickly remove customers who requested to stop receiving calls:
```json
{
  "campaign_id": "0b52ca2b-7767-4cb5-ac4c-b2a4f892a856",
  "mobile_numbers": ["+918882876897", "+918882876898"]
}
```

### Data Cleanup
Remove invalid or problematic numbers while keeping campaign active.

### Compliance Management
Honor do-not-call requests without stopping entire campaign.

## Important Details

### Number Format
- ✅ Include country code: `+918882876897`
- ✅ Use international format: `+1234567890`
- ❌ Don't use local format: `8882876897`

### Limitations
- **Maximum**: 100 numbers per request
- **Scope**: Only affects specified campaign
- **Status**: Only terminates registered/retry calls

### What Happens
- **Immediate**: Queued calls to these numbers are cancelled
- **Retry Calls**: Scheduled retries are also cancelled  
- **Other Campaigns**: Same numbers in other campaigns continue
- **Completed Calls**: Already finished calls remain in history

<Info>
**Pro Tip**: Use this endpoint to implement real-time opt-out functionality in your application. Customers can request removal and you can immediately stop their calls.
