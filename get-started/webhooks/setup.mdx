## Overview

Revenueable AI's event-based webhook system allows you to subscribe to specific events for your AI agents and receive real-time callbacks when those events occur. This eliminates the need to continuously poll our API for updates.

## Event Types

Our webhook system supports four main event types. You can subscribe to **any or all** of these events based on your needs:

| Event Type | Trigger | Data Included |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `call_completed` | Every call attempt finishes | Transcript, duration, status, custom args |
| `recording_completed` | Recording is processed and ready | Recording URL and duration |
| `platform_analysis_completed` | AI analysis completes | Key points, summary, classification |
| `client_analysis_completed` | Custom analysis completes | Results based on your custom prompts |

## Configuration

To subscribe an agent to webhook events, use this PATCH request:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://prod-api.revenueable.ai/ca/api/v0/agent/v1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_token_here' \
--header 'X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here' \
--data '{
    "operation": "edit_event_subscriptions",
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "event_subscriptions": [
        {
            "event_type": "call_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/call-completed",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-webhook-token",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        },
        {
            "event_type": "recording_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/recording-completed",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-webhook-token",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        },
        {
            "event_type": "platform_analysis_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/platform-analysis",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-webhook-token",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        },
        {
            "event_type": "client_analysis_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/client-analysis",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-webhook-token",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Subscription Flexibility

You have complete flexibility in choosing which events to subscribe to:


### Subscribe to Only Call Completion
```json
{
    "operation": "edit_event_subscriptions",
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "event_subscriptions": [
        {
            "event_type": "call_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/calls",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-webhook-token",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Subscribe to Analysis Events Only
```json
{
    "operation": "edit_event_subscriptions",
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "event_subscriptions": [
        {
            "event_type": "platform_analysis_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/analysis",
            "headers": {

            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        },
        {
            "event_type": "client_analysis_completed",
            "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/custom",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-webhook-token",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "method_type": "POST"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Requirements

### Webhook Endpoint
Provide the full HTTPS URL where webhook notifications should be sent.

### Authentication
Configure custom headers for secure webhook delivery. Common patterns:
- `Authorization: Bearer your-webhook-token`
- Custom API keys in headers
- Additional security headers as needed

### HTTP Methods
Supported methods:
- **POST** (recommended)
- **PUT** 
- **PATCH**

### Response Requirements
Your endpoint must:
- Return HTTP 200 status code to acknowledge receipt
- Respond within 30 seconds to avoid timeout
- Handle duplicate events using `call_id` for idempotency
