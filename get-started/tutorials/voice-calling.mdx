Revenueable AI's Voice API enables businesses to create and manage AI-powered voice calls, enhancing customer interactions through intelligent voice assistants.

## Voice API Overview

Revenueable AI's Voice Calling system supports two primary call types:

- **Inbound Calls**: Users call a designated number and interact with an AI assistant
- **Outbound Calls**: Revenueable AI initiates calls to users via telephony partners, connecting them to an AI assistant

The platform manages the entire call lifecycle, from initiation to completion, while providing comprehensive analytics and management tools.

## How Voice Calling Works

Revenueable AI uses a sophisticated system to connect callers with AI assistants:

- **Assistants**: AI voice agents that handle conversations based on predefined goals
- **Numbers**: Phone numbers connected to assistants that serve as the point of contact
- **Telephony Partners**: Underlying infrastructure that connects calls
- **Custom Variables**: Dynamic data points that personalize conversations

---

## Relationship Between Assistants and Calls

Each call is connected to a specific assistant that manages the conversation. The assistant is linked to a phone number, which serves as the point of contact for inbound calls or the caller ID for outbound calls. This relationship ensures that calls are routed to the appropriate assistant with the relevant context and capabilities.

## Call States and Lifecycle

Calls progress through several states during their lifecycle:

- **Call Initiated**: The call has been requested but not yet connected
- **Call Transferred**: The call has been transferred to the assistant
- **Ongoing**: The call is currently active
- **Call Completed**: The call has ended normally
- **Call Failed**: The call did not connect or ended unexpectedly
