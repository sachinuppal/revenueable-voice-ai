## Initiate Individual Call

Start a new outbound call to a specific recipient using your configured AI agent. This endpoint supports both immediate calls and scheduled calls for future execution.

<Warning>
**Phone Number Format**: 
- All phone numbers must include country code (e.g., +91 for India, +1 for US)
- Invalid formats will result in call failure
</Warning>

## Scheduled Calls
Use `scheduled_at` to schedule calls for a specific date and time:
```json
"call_time": {
  "call_start_time": "09:00",
  "call_end_time": "18:00", 
  "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "scheduled_at": "2025-11-24T01:55:00"
}
```

<Note>
**Scheduled Calls**: When `scheduled_at` is provided, the call will be queued and executed at that specific date and time. The time window (`call_start_time` and `call_end_time`) still applies as additional validation. Use this for precise scheduling of important calls.
</Note>

## Custom Variables

Use the `custom_args_values` field to pass dynamic data to your agent:
- Reference variables in your agent prompt using `@{{variable_name}}` syntax
- Common variables: `callee_name`, `company_name`, `appointment_date`, etc.
- Variables are replaced with actual values during the call

## Important Notes

- **Agent Configuration**: Ensure your agent is properly configured with prompts and variables
- **From Numbers**: Use phone numbers that are provisioned in your workspace
- **Credits**: Each call consumes credits based on duration and destination
- **Retry Logic**: Configure retry attempts for busy/failed calls in `call_config`
